# ONECore - Property XPAND Adapter

POC to investigate Prisma as data-layer between Xpand and ONECore


## Development

### Requirements

This application requires the following to be installed on your system:


 * **npm**
 * **Node.js**
 * **Docker**

### Install Instructions

#### Prepare environment

Run the `dev:init` script to create a file called `.env`, or manually make a copy of `.env.template`:


```sh
$ npm run dev:init
```

Or:


```sh
$ cp .env.template .env
```

#### Install dependencies

Install dependencies


```sh
$ npm run install
```

#### Optional but recommended

Install a Prisma extension for the editor of your choice to get syntax highlighting and automatic formatting. https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/development-environment/editor-setup


### Running in Development Mode

When all installation steps have been completed and downstreams services are running, a local development instance can be started using:


```sh
$ npm run undefined
```

### Prisma

The schema files define the database structure and are the blueprints used by the Prisma client.


The client resides in `node_modules` and is generated by running `prisma generate`.


Changes to the schema require a new generation of the client. Run `npm run force-generate` to remove node_modules, install the dependencies and generate a new client.


### Prisma AI Renamer

To convert schemas first install the prisma-ai-renamer tool and then run to convert a model


These prompts for the tool are placed in the prompts folder which means we can easily change the prompts if we want the tool to be better at understanding our purposes.
