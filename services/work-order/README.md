# ONECore - Work Order

Microservice for managing work orders in ONECore. This microservice integrates with Odoo (an open-source ERP system) to handle work orders efficiently, allowing us to sync work orders between ONECore and Odoo, retrieve and update work order details, and ensure data consistency across both systems.
