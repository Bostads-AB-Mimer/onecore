# ONECore - Property Management Microservice

Microservice for property management in ONECore.


## Overview

### Swagger

We utilize `koa2-swagger-ui` and `swagger-jsdoc` for documenting our API. Each endpoint is required to have appropriate
JSDoc comments and tags for comprehensive documentation. The Swagger document is exposed on `/swagger`.


## Development

### Requirements

This application requires the following to be installed on your system:


 * **nvm**
 * **npm**
 * **Node.js**
 * **Docker**

### Install Instructions

#### Prepare environment

Run the `dev:init` script to create a file called `.env`, or manually make a copy of `.env.template`:


```sh
$ npm run dev:init
```

Or:


```sh
$ cp .env.template .env
```

#### Install runtime

Install the required node version, if not already installed.


```sh
$ nvm install
```

Activate the required node version.


```sh
$ nvm use
```

#### Install dependencies

Install dependencies


```sh
$ npm run install
```

#### Configure services

Start the development services from the monorepo root directory:


```sh
<monorepo root> $ docker-compose up -d &
```

This will start the required services inside a Docker container. This is a shared container used by all services, and it only needs to be started once.


#### Setup database

Create an empty database for the application:


```sh
$ docker compose exec -i sql /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P p455w0rd -Q "CREATE DATABASE [tenants-leases];"
```

#### Prepare database

Create the database schema by applying the `knex` migrations:


```sh
$ npm run migrate:up
```

### Running in Development Mode

When all installation steps have been completed and downstreams services are running, a local development instance can be started using:


```sh
$ npm run dev
```
