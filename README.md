Monorepo containing all base services and applications of the ONECore platform.

## Overview

### Repository structure

Apart from the core orchestration service, packages belong to one of three categories:

- **`apps`** - User-facing frontend applications
- **`libs`** - Libraries containing common functionality
- **`services`** - Microservices that provide ONECore features

### Getting started

#### Requirements

After cloning the repository, make sure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **nvm**
- **npm**
- **Node.js**
- **Docker**

#### Install runtime

Install the required node version using `nvm`, if not already installed.

```sh
nvm install
```

Activate the required node version.

```sh
nvm use
```

#### Install dependencies

Install dependencies. This may take 1-2 minutes, as it will resolve and download all packages required by all ONECore modules, as well as check for version conflicts.

```sh
npm install
```

#### Run dev:init

This will run any one-off initialization scripts in all modules that provide them.  
Nearly all modules use dotenv/.env-files that are required to run with a local configuration, and these will be created with default values.
Some of these still require manual attention after running this script, as some applications depend on non-public resources.

```sh
npm run dev:init
```

#### Run generate:static

This will generate required code that is not subject to version control.

```sh
npm run generate:static
```

#### Build libs

Most projects rely on the projects under libs/ and will not run or build unless they are built in your local project tree.

```sh
npm run build:libs
```

#### Dockerized services

Some services depend on databases and kibana/elastic-search for logging. These can all be started as local Docker containers using `docker compose`

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

These services will apply schema migrations/updates as needed on startup, but they will not create the logical schema/database.

Once the SQL container is running, you can create these by running:

```sh
npm run db:init
```

### Local development

[Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/) lets us run multiple packages simultaneously in a tidy manner using its "tui" configuration.

```sh
npm run dev # runs everything
npm run dev -- --filter='!@onecore/property' # runs everything except for @onecore/property
npm run dev -- --filter='@onecore/property' # runs only @onecore/property
```

Furthermore, turborepo handles different packages dependencies. If we run @onecore/leasing, which uses libs/types and libs/utilities, both of these packages will be built before leasing starts.
